# AI-Driven Decision Support Dashboard for E-Commerce

## Introduction
E-commerce platforms generate large volumes of product pricing data and customer reviews over time. 
However, converting this data into meaningful and actionable insights for decision-making remains a challenge. 
Most traditional dashboards focus on raw statistics without providing intelligent interpretation or contextual understanding.

This project presents an **AI-driven Decision Support Dashboard** that integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, 
**time-frame–based analysis**, and **DevOps-enabled deployment** to assist users in making informed e-commerce decisions.

## Problem Statement
Current e-commerce analytics tools suffer from the following limitations:

- Difficulty in interpreting price variations across platforms within a selected time frame  
- Inadequate analysis of customer sentiment trends over time  
- Limited visualization for historical and comparative analytics  
- Lack of automated, version-controlled, and maintainable deployment workflows  

There is a need for an intelligent, scalable, and interpretable decision support system.

---

## Proposed Solution
The proposed system is an AI-powered dashboard designed to:

- Analyze product pricing data across user-defined time frames  
- Apply LLM-based sentiment and aspect-level analysis on customer reviews  
- Present insights through interactive and decision-oriented visualizations  
- Employ Git-based version control and DevOps pipelines for automation and scalability  

The platform focuses on **decision facilitation** rather than prediction.

## System Architecture Overview
The system follows a modular and scalable architecture:

- **Data Layer:** Structured pricing and review datasets organized by time intervals  
- **AI Layer:**  
  - LLMs for sentiment classification, aspect extraction, and review summarization  
- **Backend Layer:** API-based services for time-frame–specific data retrieval  
- **Visualization Layer:** Dashboards for price trends, sentiment distribution, and comparisons  
- **DevOps Layer:** Git-managed repositories with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment

- AI-enabled decision support systems  

---

## Future Scope
- Advanced decision recommendations based on historical trends  
- Expansion to multiple product categories  
- Improved interpretability using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques  

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Large Language Models, data visualization, and DevOps practices** can be combined to build an effective decision support dashboard for e-commerce analytics. 
By emphasizing time-frame–based analysis and interpretability, the system bridges the gap between raw data and informed decision-making.
